# Installation Guide for Raspberry Pi Baby Monitor

This guide walks through the steps to set up the Raspberry Pi, install the necessary software, and prepare it for use with the Baby Monitor.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4 (or other compatible Raspberry Pi model)
- Raspberry Pi OS (Lite version is recommended for minimal setup)
- SD card (8GB or larger recommended)
- Micro-USB power supply
- Monitor or TV for initial setup (optional)
- Keyboard and mouse (optional, for setup without SSH)

## Step 1: Flashing the SD Card with Raspberry Pi OS

1. **Download the Raspberry Pi Imager**:  
   Visit the [Raspberry Pi Imager page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and download the imager for your operating system.

2. **Install the Raspberry Pi OS**:  
   - Insert your SD card into your computer.
   - Open the Raspberry Pi Imager and select Raspberry Pi OS (Lite) from the list of available operating systems (recommend 32 bit).
   - Choose the SD card and click **Write** to begin the flashing process.

3. **Edit Settings Before Flashing**:  
   - In the Raspberry Pi Imager, before starting the flashing process, click on the **settings** icon (gear icon) on the bottom right of the imager window.
   - Enable **SSH** to allow remote access.
   - Set your **username** and **password** for the Pi (remember them!).
   - Configure your **Wi-Fi** settings:  
     - Enter your **Wi-Fi network name (SSID)** and **password**.
     - Set the correct **country code** to ensure proper Wi-Fi operation.

4. **Complete the Flashing**:  
   After you have set everything up, proceed with flashing the SD card. Once the flashing process is complete, remove the SD card from your computer.


## Step 2: Set Up SSH Access (for headless setup)
After flashing, you'll need to enable SSH on your Raspberry Pi:
1. **Create the `ssh` file**:  
   - If you haven't already enabled SSH in the imager settings, you need to create an empty file named `ssh` (without any file extension) in the boot partition of the SD card.  
   - Insert the SD card into your computer and create the `ssh` file in the root of the boot partition.

2. **Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi**:  
   - Once SSH is enabled, insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Connect the Raspberry Pi to a Network**:  
   - If you configured Wi-Fi during the flashing process, the Pi should connect automatically.
   - If not, or if you're troubleshooting, connect the Pi to the network via an Ethernet cable.

4. **Find the Piâ€™s IP Address**:  
   - Make sure your client (e.g. desktop/laptop) is on the same Wi-Fi network as the Raspberry Pi host.
   - Use a network scanner like `nmap` (download for windows) to find the IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi.
   - If the Raspberry Pi is connected to a monitor (e.g. for initial setup), the device should tell you its IP address once fully booted
   - If no monitor is conneted, open powershell on the client and type in the following line to identify devices on the local network

   ```bash
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

5. **SSH into the Raspberry Pi**:  
   - Once you've identified the IP address, open a command prompt or power shell on your computer and run the following command to SSH into your Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<your_pi_ip_address>
   ```

   - Enter the password that you specied during the flashing process

6. **Setup Wi-Fi, if needed**:
   - If your Raspberry Pi did not automatically connect to Wi-Fi and/or if you performed the initial setup with the device connected to a router via ethernet cable (like me), you can now create the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file
   - In power shell, type the following to open the new file:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa
   ```
   - Then type the following, and finally hit ctrl+X to save and exit.

   ```bash
   country=CH
   ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
   update_config=1
   network={
       ssid="your_wifi_network"
       psk="your_wifi_password"
   }
   ```

   - Finally, reboot the device:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - If you had previously connected to the Raspberry Pi via an ethernet cable, unplug it and run the nmap command again to find the IP address (or find it on a connected screen). Note that it may be different than before.


## 5. Set Up Your Raspberry Pi

Once you're logged into the Raspberry Pi:

1. Update the system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

3. Set up the camera module:

    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```

    - Select `Interfacing Options` -> `Camera` -> Enable.
    - Reboot the Raspberry Pi.


















## 6. Clone the Repository

Now that your Raspberry Pi is set up, clone the Baby Monitor project repository:

1. On your computer, open a terminal or use VS Code to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RaspberryPiBabyMonitor.git
    ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd RaspberryPiBabyMonitor
    ```

## 7. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies to run the project:

1. Install `pip` (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 8. Run the Application

Finally, start the application:

1. Run the `video_stream.py` script:

    ```bash
    python3 src/video_stream.py
    ```

2. Visit `http://<raspberry_pi_ip>:<port>` in a browser to view the live stream.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your camera module is correctly connected.
- Double-check the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file for accurate Wi-Fi details.
